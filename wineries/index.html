They also want to share their views on wine, creating greater democracy in the wine experience where comments and ratings are driven by a global wine community rather than a few commentators.  They also want to buy wine in the most efficient and cost effective way.</h3>

      <p>This app gives wine producers an additional channel to promote their wine.  If they have no in-line presence we can provide the tools to quickly get them there.  If there is an established on-line presence we provide a complimentary channel to the global market.  With very little input of time producers can dynamically connect directly with their consumers with updates on new and old vintages, special events, commentary by winemakers.  Text, pictures and video clips will all be supported.</p>
      <p>The analytics produced by the consumer activity will allow producers to monitor macro trends in consumption, specific interest in their wines and comments on visits to their cellar door.  This will help them to better leverage their distribution network and create opportunities to penetrate new markets.</p>
